I have developed an Android application that can help to solve the toll problems faced in India.

Primarily what I'm doing is, Clicking the picture of the vehicle Number plate and applying Optical Character Recognition to fetch the text from the image and then from the database grabbing the Vehicle information. 
Using that information I'll notify the user by sending SMS that he has to pay the toll.
Users can use the app to pay the payment using any UPI method.

There more other exciting features in the app such as,

Parking Location Mark, User can save their current location where they have parked the car.

Users can use it to check if they are not feeling well by entering the symptoms and the app will tell the disease.

Users can silent their phone by entering the Day and Time Period.

All Vehicle Company Toll-free number in the app.
